    "What Is Functional Programming?\n",
    "Functional programming is a style (or \"paradigm\" if you're pretentious) of programming where we compose functions instead of mutating state (updating the value of variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen.\n",
    "Imperative (or procedural) programming declares both the what and the how.\n",
    "Example of imperative code:\n",
    "\n",
    "car = create_car()\n",
    "car.add_gas(10)\n",
    "car.clean_windows()\n",
    "Copy icon\n",
    "Example of functional code:\n",
    "\n",
    "return clean_windows(add_gas(create_car()))\n",
    "Copy icon\n",
    "The important distinction is that in the functional example, we never change the value of the car variable, we just compose functions that return new values, with the outermost function, clean_windows in this case, returning the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Doc\n",
    "In this course, we're working on \"Doc2Doc\", a command line tool for converting documents from one format to another. If you're familiar with Pandoc, the idea is similar.\n",

    "Center the title before adding the border.\n",

    "Immutability\n",
    "In FP, we strive to make data immutable. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Mutable data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who Cares?\n",
    "Immutable data is easier to think about and work with. When 10 different functions have access to the same variable, and you're debugging a problem with that variable, you have to consider the possibility that any of those functions could have changed the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable is immutable, you can be sure that it hasn't changed since it was created. It's a helluva lot easier to work with.\n",

    "Tuples vs. Lists\n",
    "Tuples and lists are both ordered collections of values, but tuples are immutable and lists are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can append to a list, but you can not append to a tuple. You can create a new copy of a tuple using values from an existing tuple, but you can't change the existing tuple.\n",

    "Return the documents tuple with the new document added to the end.\n",
    "Run the code to see the error. Whoever wrote this code assumed that documents is a list, but it's a tuple!\n",

    "avg is equal to the sum of all the numbers in collection \"x\" divided by the number of elements in collection \"x\".\n",
