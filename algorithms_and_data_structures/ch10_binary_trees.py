# Trees are a widely used data structure that simulate a hierarchical… well… tree structure. 
# That said, they’re typically drawn upside down - the “root” node is at the top, and the “leaves” are at the bottom.
# A generic tree structure has the following rules:
    # Each node has a value and a list of “children”
    # Children can only have a single “parent”
# One of the most common types of ordered tree is a Binary Search Tree or BST. In addition to the properties we’ve already talked about, a BST has some additional constraints:
    # Instead of an unbounded list of children, each node has at most 2 children
    # The left child’s value must be less than its parent’s value
    # The right child’s value must be greater than its parent’s value
    # No two nodes in the BST can have the same value
